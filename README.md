Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi!

My project is about one of my main interests and it is developing e-learning courses.
I decided to make a webpage describing most important elements of this process and to show what I have learned during first two weeks of CS50's Web course :)

My project consists of four html files for every page of the site, main style.css, scss files and a folder with pictures.

I included in my project a lot of elements and technics so it corresponds to the requirements.

Please see my screencast in which I demonstrate it's functionality and code.
