                    <h3>How to build an effective and engaging scenario:</h3>
                    <p>A scenario in an eLearning course is essentially a story. It has a plot, characters, and a problem that the learners resolve. The plot mirrors the workplace reality of the learners. The protagonist has a similar life situation as that of the learners; he shares their goals and aspirations and is plagued by the same workplace woes as they are. He is up against an antagonist that is actually the problem that the course has set out to resolve.</p>
                        <p>Your work is cut out! You have to create an engaging interactive scenario that feels "real" to your learners. They should be able to relate to the protagonist and find him believable when he guides and advises them.</p>
                        <p>Scenario-based eLearning (SBL) courses combine the magical appeal and relevance of stories with the realism of hands-on training within a virtual environment. Virtual scenarios let learners gather professional expertise and experience within a much shorter duration than what they would have obtained from just working at their real jobs. What is more, scenario-based learning lets them learn through a trial-and-error process that is as effective as getting an on-job training but without having to face the consequences or bear the costs of a wrong decision.</p>

                    <h4 class="alert-heading">Remember!</h4>
                    <p>Fairy tales do a better job of teaching kids the values of honesty and hard work than all the dressing-down you may administer or the sermons you deliver. Kids learn from examples.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="mb-0">Adults are no different. They feel inspired by the stories of struggle, hardship, courage, and triumph of our real-life heroes and feel motivated to emulate them.</p>
